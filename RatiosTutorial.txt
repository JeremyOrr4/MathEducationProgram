Welcome to a Ratios tutorial.

This will be very easy and will only be working with ratios that are multiples of each other.

Lets start with a ratio of 1:5. We are not trying to find x using this given ratio and are given x:10.

Well, since we know 5x2 is equal to 10, we must now multiply 1 by 2 to get our x answer.

An example:

Given ratio: 20:25.

Find x: x:50.

Since 25 x 2 = 50, 20 x 2 must equal x.

x = 40.
