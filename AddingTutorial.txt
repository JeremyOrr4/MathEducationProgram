Welcome to an adding tuttorial!

We will be only adding with numbers with one or two digits.

Firstly, to add take your two numbers and line them up so each colum lines up perfectly. The onese with the ones and tens  with tens.

Here is an example
 
         9
       + 2
----------------
       =
or

        10
      + 14
----------------
       =

Now we add each colum together to get the answer!

For example 13 + 3. We add the ones coloum to get 6 and the tens to get 1. So it equals 16.

An exception is when a coloum equals 10>=, we add the 1 to the next colum and bring down the ones comlum.
