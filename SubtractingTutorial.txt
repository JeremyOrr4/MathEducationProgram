Welcome to a subtracting tutorial.

We will be only adding with numbers with one or two digits.

Firstly, to add take your two numbers and line them up so each colum lines up perfectly. The onese with the ones and tens  with tens.

Here is an example
 
         4
       - 2
----------------
       =
or

        18
      - 12
----------------
       =

Now we subtract each coloum together to get the answer!

Note, if the top number is smaller then the bottom, simply flip it, find the answer and then add a negitive to it.

Like this

        5
      - 9
----------------
       =

        9
      - 5
----------------
       = 4

It equals -4!
